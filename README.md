# ASR
Automatic speech recognition for Tiva-C LaunchPad

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Finished with the MFCC. 
ADC (with DMA) finished!
Now, onto Forward Algorithm for Probabilty Evaluation. I will find the Baumâ€“Welch algorithm online for parameter reestimation. In MATLAB.

All the files besides are included, except for TivaWare libraries, which can be easily downloaded from the web.


Short description of MFCC: it is used for extracting the most useful components from human speech. It works by applying a filter bank of triangular filters to signal spectruum. This filterbank gives more priority to lower frequencies.
