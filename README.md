# ASR
Automatic speech recognition for Tiva-C LaunchPad

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Finished with the MFCC. 
ADC (with DMA) finished!
Now, onto Forward Algorithm for Probabilty Evaluation. I will use the Baumâ€“Welch algorithm for parameter reestimation. Python library that will do the job,called hmmlearn, is available online.

Feature dependency has really halted progress. I will have to fix these singular matrices.

All the files are included, except for TivaWare libraries, which can be easily downloaded from the web.


Short description of MFCC: it is used for extracting the most useful components from human speech. It works by applying a filter bank of triangular filters to signal spectruum. This filterbank gives more priority to lower frequencies.
