Automatic speech recognition for Tiva-C LaunchPad

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Finished with the MFCC. ADC is next. Updates soon.


Short description of MFCC: it is used for extracting the most useful components from human speech. It works by applying a filter bank of triangular filters to signal spectruum. This filterbank gives more priority to lower frequencies.
